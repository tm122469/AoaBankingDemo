# Telco Churn Modeling 

This is a ficticious dataset of telco customers.  Feature engineering has been done previously in the Dataiku demo.  We use that same prepared data and build a Logistic Regression model using Vantage Analytics Library.  Then we build a Random Forest model in scikit-learn and deploy it back in Vantage via BYOM.
