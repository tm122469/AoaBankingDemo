# Credit Card Propensity 

This is a simplistic ficticious dataset of banking customers (10K-ish rows), Accounts (20K-ish rows) and Transactions (1M-ish rows).

Within this use case, we explore the raw data using the VAL Descriptive Statistical functions along with many different plots and graphs. Based upon our findings, we begin to assemble an analytic data set through a combination of VAL Transformation functions, as well as the pandas/SQLAlchemy support in teradataml. Finally, we use Logistic Regression to predict which of our existing customer base has the highest propensity to open up a credit card account.
